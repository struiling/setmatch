## Migration to another Parse account
Set up new app in Parse
Replace values in config/global.json
Import existing data (if really starting from scratch and losing all data, make sure a Global group is set up and references in user signup functions are defined, along with hard-coded trait IDs)

If not importing data and starting from scratch, you must create a Global group, set it to secretive, and create basic traits for First Name and Last Name, and set them in settings.js
